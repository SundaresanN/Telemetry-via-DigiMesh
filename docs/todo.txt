Currently, these scripts have one purpose - to create multiple one-to-one GCS to vehicle MAVLink
connections that share the same wireless DigiMesh network and one common GCS XBee radio.  However,
future commits will aim to improve the usefulness, versatility and reliability of these scripts.

Below is a prioritized list of TODOs as of April 1<sup>st</sup> 2019:

1. Prevent threads from crashing when UDP servers are closed.  Attempt to reconnect.
2. USB rules for GCS computer and companion computer so admin priviledges are not required to run
scripts.
3. Remove magic numbers and add command line argument passing.  Overall code tidy-up.
4. Exit scripts appropriately by closing all open ports and serial connections.
5. Cleaner initialization process for all GCS and vehicles on the mesh network.
6. Live console for functions to be executed during script operation.
7. Investigate rediscovery of devices that have left the mesh network and rejoined.
8. Non-explicit broadcasts to all devices on the network.
9. Ensure threads that may access the same area of memory cannot do so simultaneously,
avoiding unnecessary crashes.
10. Interface option for companion computer script to interface with other companion computer
software, as opposed to directly with the Pixhawk.
11. Windows support for GCS script.
12. TCP and serial options for interfacing with GCS software.
